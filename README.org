The code will only work on macOS in its current state.

** Building

In order for SPM to build ImGui, it was necessary to create symlinks for the relevant
header files.  The Makefile in its directory does this for you: ~make symlinks~ makes
them and ~make clean-symlinks~ removes them.

Then the usual SPM commands should handle the rest, e.g do ~swift run~.

*** Dependencies

The repository holds the following dependencies as submodules:
- [[https://github.com/floooh/sokol][sokol]] (fork)
- [[https://github.com/ocornut/imgui][Dear ImGui]] (docking)

The following dependencies must be installed:
- [[https://www.glfw.org][GLFW]] (e.g. ~brew install glfw~). The code currently assumes GLFW was installed via
  [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]]. This assumption is relevant for SPM to find the headers and library to
  link.
